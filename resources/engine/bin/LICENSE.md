The Steam API redistributable binaries are created and maintained solely by the Valve Corporation (Valve LLC).

Before removing these binaries (if you do not plan on utilizing the Steamworks API),
add `-DCHIRA_BUILD_WITH_STEAMWORKS=OFF` to your CMake build command or buildscript and rebuild the engine.
